# City-Supply-and-Demand-Data

Analyze city supply and demand for a ride sharing company.

Objectives of this project is th eanalysis of -
1. Which date had the most completed trips during the two week period?
2. What was the highest number of completed trips within a 24 hour period?
3. Which hour of the day had the most requests during the two week period?
4. What percentage of all zeroes during the two week period occurred on the weekend (Friday at 5 pm to Sunday at 3 am)?
5. What is the weighted average ratio of completed trips per driver during the two week period?
6. In drafting a driver schedule in terms of 8 hours shifts, when are the busiest 8 consecutive hours over the two week period in terms of unique requests? A new shift starts every 8 hours. Assume that a driver will work the same shift each day.
7. True or False: Driver supply always increases when demand increases during the two week period.
8. In which 72 hour period is the ratio of Zeroes to Eyeballs the highest?
9. If you could add 5 drivers to any single hour of every day during the two week period, which hour should you add them to?
10.True or False: There are exactly two weeks of data in this analysis.
11. Looking at all of the data, which time might make the most sense to consider a true "end day" instead of midnight? (i.e when are both supply and demand at their natural minimums)
